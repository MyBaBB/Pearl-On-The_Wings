# Issue with GSAP
### I tried every combination.
*  When applying more than one GSAP Animation it breaks in VSCode.
*  I tried every way possible, but it doesn't work properly.
*  It does show up live just fine, but not for testing.
*  Test one animation at a time only. 
*  Delete the reference to the animation until test complete and the reinstall before launching it live.
